# Easy Projects

The following are the descriptions and learning outcomes of each easy-difficulty project by JetBrains Academy.

### Coffee Machine (machine/)
#### About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
#### Learning Outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.


### Hangman (hangman/)
#### About
Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!
#### Learning Outcomes
Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.


### Tic-Tac-Toe (tictactoe/)
#### About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
#### Learning Outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.


### Simple Chatty Bot (bot/)
#### About
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!
#### Learning Outcomes
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.


### Credit Calculator (creditcalc/)
#### About
Finance is an important part of the life of any people. Sometimes you think about getting additional income and want to open a deposit account. And sometimes you need additional money right now and want to take a credit or mortgage. Anyway, you may want to calculate different financial indicators to make a decision. Let’s make such an instrument that can help us.
#### Learning Outcomes
You’ll learn how to use mathematics and Python in everyday tasks, use third-party modules and libraries. Also, you’ll learn more about different financial instruments. Finally, you will make your own credit calculator!


### Zookeeper (zookeeper/)
#### About
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.
#### Learning Outcomes
This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.
