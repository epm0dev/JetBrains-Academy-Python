# Challenging Projects

The following are the descriptions and learning outcomes of each challenging-difficulty project by JetBrains Academy.

### Hypercar Service Center (hypercar/)
#### About
Web services are particularly useful when it comes to structuring and organizing things. What needs structure more than a crowd of waiting customers? With the help of Django, you'll implement an application that manages the line at a car service center.

You will learn how to start a Django project, handle requests, and make templates for your HTML pages. After completing this project, you'll know how to build simple web services with Django.

### HyperNews Portal (hypernews/)
#### About
The times of sitting down with a coffee and reading a newspaper seem to have passed. Now everyone gets news from their laptops or phones, so online news websites are very popular. These sites specialize on the collecting and sharing general news or materials on some specific topic. Some are independent projects, and others, like The New York Times, expanded from what wasn't initially made for the online world. What they all have in common is their basic structure. In this project, you will create a web application for online news with the help of Django.
#### Learning Outcomes
You will learn the basics of Django: handle data through HTTP and work with templates. In addition, you will gain new skills working with JSON files and Python DateTime type.

### HyperJob Agency (hyperjob/)
#### About
Web services are useful to share information almost instantly. You publish a resume, and in five minutes an employer is inviting you to the interview. Moreover, there are many employees and employers are meeting each other at the same place. With the help of Django, you'll create this application for the HyperJob agency.
#### Learning Outcomes
You will learn how to create a dynamic web site with Django. You will practice your skills in creating content in the database and serving the data through HTTP. To make pages adaptive, you create templates instead of simple HTML pages. After completing this project, you will be able to create another client-server application by yourself.
