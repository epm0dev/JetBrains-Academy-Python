#### Learning Outcomes
A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.


### Numeric Matrix Processor (processor/)
#### About

If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.
#### Learning Outcomes
Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using nested lists in practice.
