# Medium Projects

The following are the descriptions and learning outcomes of each medium-difficulty project (that I've completed thus far) by JetBrains Academy.

### Simple Banking System (banking/)
#### About
Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database.
#### Learning Outcomes
In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL. We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Python.


### Rock-Paper-Scissors (rps/)
#### About
If youâ€™ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.
#### Learning Outcomes
A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.
