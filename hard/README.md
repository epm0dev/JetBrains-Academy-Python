# Hard Projects

The following are the descriptions and learning outcomes of each medium-difficulty project by JetBrains Academy.

### Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (tictactoe/)
#### About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
#### Learning Outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and functions, handling errors, and processing user input. You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.


### Text-Based Browser (...)
#### About
Sometimes you need to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal. So, let's use Python to create a text-based browser! Of course, making a real, full-blown browser is a very difficult task. In this project, you'll create a very simple browser that will ignore JavaScript and CSS, won't have cookies, and will only process a limited set of tags. Still, it will be useful and, most importantly, fun to program!
#### Learning Outcomes
You will learn how HTTP works and how to handle its protocols using Python. You will also learn all about Python input/output, as well as parsing HTML.


### To-Do List (...)
#### About
To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce the stress in your life and get more done in less time. It also helps you become more reliable for other people and save time for the best things in life. So let's implement it!
#### Learning Outcomes
To-Do list that will help you manage your tasks. You will practice using loops, conditions and statement branches. And also you will learn the basics of SQLAlchemy to manage SQLite database on python!


### Smart Calculator (...)
#### About
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.
#### Learning Outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.


### Password Hacker (...)
#### About
All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project you’ll wear the hat of a real hacker. You must connect to a secret server without knowing the password. Your task is to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.
#### Learning Outcomes
You will learn how hacking works. You will work with iterators and generators, and you’ll learn a little something about the itertools module – one of the most powerful features of Python. You will practice developing a client app and connecting to a server using the socket module. The project will also get you acquainted with JSON and the time module.
